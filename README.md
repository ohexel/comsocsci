A guide to computational social science resources
=================================================
A collection of resources and readings for people wanting to get acquainted with computational social science. This started out as a way for us to collect resources that we found useful or interesting. Credit goes to [@andrewnolanhall](https://github.com/andrewnolanhall/) for pitching the idea at [Data Science Nights@Northwestern](http://www.data-science-nights.org/). Links to similar collections at the bottom. Text in quotes is taken directly from the website or document. The rest is our editorializing. Suggestions welcome. WIP.

Ideas to gather resources for this guide: 
- [Syllabus](https://www.bitbybitbook.com) included to access readings alongside Bit by Bit book 
- Perspectives on Computational Analysis [Syllabus](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-analysis)


### Training
[Starting from zero, Data Carpentry workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/): "This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 hours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting."

These resources are intended for in-person workshops but can be used by self-learners.

For people coming from `Stata` and wanting to learn `R`: [R for Stata users](http://r4stats.com/books/r4stata/). An earlier draft is available for free.

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)
  - Lessons and interactive tutorials for beginners and experts in data analysis. 
  - [DataCamp for Northwestern University students](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/campus-events/data-camp.html) Offered for free to Northwestern students.  Students can sign up to receive a pass to all courses at the beginning of each quarter. They run out of free passes, so be sure to jump on this at the beginning of the quarter! You need to complete the free intro courses of either Python or R before being able to get access, so complete that first.

[Chromebook Data Science project](http://jhudatascience.org/chromebookdatascience/cbds.html): "Chromebook Data Science (CBDS) is an online educational program to help anyone who can read, write, and use a computer to move into data science. It is offered by faculty members in the Johns Hopkins Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. There are currently 12 courses that are offered in the Chromebook Data Science Curriculum."

[UK Data Service Data Skills Modules](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/use-data/data-skills-modules): "These introductory level interactive modules are designed for users who want to get to grips with keys aspects of survey, longitudinal and aggregate data."

[Bernard E. Harcourt, _Against Prediction_ (tree version)](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo4101022.html) Summary: _Against Prediction_ argues that predictive policing models not “crime” but “arrests”, i.e. police behavior, not the supposed underlying behavior (not what crimes will happen where, but who will be arrested). Therefore, it will reinforce existing trends in policing instead of “improving” policing.

[Thoughts on algorithmic fairness](http://joshualoftus.com/post/algorithmic-fairness-is-as-hard-as-causation/): "Algorithmic fairness is an interdisciplinary research field concerned with the various ways that algorithms may perpetuate or reinforce unfair legacies of our history, and how we might modify the alorithms or systems they are used in to prevent this. For example, if the training data used in a machine learning methods contains patterns caused by things like racism, sexism, ableism, or other types of injustice, then the model may learn those patterns and use them to make predictions and decisions that are unfair. There are many ways that technology can have unintended consequences, and this is just one of them."
