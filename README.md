A guide to computational social science resources
=================================================
A collection of resources and readings for people wanting to get acquainted with computational social science. This started out as a way for us to collect resources that we found useful or interesting. Credit goes to [@andrewnolanhall](https://github.com/andrewnolanhall/) for pitching the idea at [Data Science Nights@Northwestern](http://www.data-science-nights.org/). Links to similar collections at the bottom. Text in quotes is taken directly from the website or document. The rest is our editorializing. Suggestions welcome. WIP.

Ideas to gather resources for this guide: 
- [Syllabus](https://www.bitbybitbook.com) included to access readings alongside Bit by Bit book 
- Perspectives on Computational Analysis [Syllabus](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-analysis)

### Training
[Fast lane to learning R](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) by Norm Matloff (prof of CompSci at UC Davis). Self-description: "This site is for those who know nothing of R, or maybe even nothing of programming, and seek QUICK, painless entree to the world of R." The course is quite thorough regarding base R, including graphics (`ggplot2` is covered as well). NM is a proponent of learning base R first before learning third-party packages and I tend to agree.

[Starting from zero, Data Carpentry workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/): "This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 hours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting."

These resources are intended for in-person workshops but can be used by self-learners.

It is offered by faculty members in the Johns Hopkins Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. There are currently 12 courses that are offered in the Chromebook Data Science Curriculum."

[Bernard E. Harcourt, _Against Prediction_ (tree version)](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo4101022.html) Summary: _Against Prediction_ argues that predictive policing models not “crime” but “arrests”, i.e. police behavior, not the supposed underlying behavior (not what crimes will happen where, but who will be arrested). Therefore, it will reinforce existing trends in policing instead of “improving” policing.

[Thoughts on algorithmic fairness](http://joshualoftus.com/post/algorithmic-fairness-is-as-hard-as-causation/): "Algorithmic fairness is an interdisciplinary research field concerned with the various ways that algorithms may perpetuate or reinforce unfair legacies of our history, and how we might modify the alorithms or systems they are used in to prevent this. For example, if the training data used in a machine learning methods contains patterns caused by things like racism, sexism, ableism, or other types of injustice, then the model may learn those patterns and use them to make predictions and decisions that are unfair. There are many ways that technology can have unintended consequences, and this is just one of them."

Following recent events at DataCamp ([here](https://blog.rladies.org/post/statement-about-datacamp/), [here](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup), [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/apology), [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/board-update)), this guide prefers to recommend other resources. The course offer is, however, comprehensive, and Northwestern University students benefit from a special offer.
